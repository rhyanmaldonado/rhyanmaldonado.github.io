  <h1>The Scarlet Letter</h1>
  <h3>by Nathaniel Hawthorne

<p> But she named the infant <em>Pearl</em>, as being of great price, purchased with all she had, her mother's only <em>treasure</em>! How strange indeed! Man had marked this woman's sin by a scarlet letter, which had such pontential disastrous efficiency that no human sympathy could reach her, save it were sinful like herself.</p>
