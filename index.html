  <h1>The Scarlet Letter</h1>
  <h3>by Nathaniel Hawthorne

<p><em>In a moment,</em> however, wisely judging that one <em>token</em> of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a <em>burning</em> blush, and yet a <em>haughty</em> smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her neighbors.
  On the breast of her gown,in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/scarletletterrom00hawtrich?ref=ol#page/58/mode/2upfine"> red cloth,</a> surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter <em>A</em>. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she <em>wore.</em><br><br>
  Hester for the win! <a href=page_two.html>link</a></p>
